Thus data from all humanities fields including modern languages, classical languages, linguistics, literature, history, jurisprudence, philosophy, archaeology, comparative religion, ethics, criticism and theory of the arts are equally welcome. While ARCHE’s predecessor, CLARIN Centre Vienna / Language Resources Portal (https://clarin.oeaw.ac.at) was dedicated to digital language resources, ARCHE offers services open to a broader range of disciplines.</p>",

Nevertheless, all deposited data is considered immutable, i.e. data with the same persistent identifier will remain unchanged.</p>",
